            <p>Todayâ€™s definitely not my day, I remembered that last night I had already charged my phone but in the
                morning the charger is not working by some reason thatâ€™s why it didnâ€™t alarm and made me wokeup late for
                class. My girlfriend really mad at me because she tried to wake me up but canâ€™t contacted me in anyway,
                she so worried that something might happened to me till she criedðŸ¥² but thisâ€™s not the only bad thing
                for today. Unlucky for me that an exam score were annouced today! And I really dissappointed to mine so
                I relaxed by playing a game with my friends, went to sleep and hope that tomorrow will be good for me
