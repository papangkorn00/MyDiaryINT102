        Last night I had a extremely nightmare! I dreamed that I got the worst score for Computer Programing subject so
        I woke up and really relieved that it was just a dream. After that I packed everything up in hurry because my
        uncle waited for me down stair to pick me up and went back home, I arrived at mid-day and ordered stewed pork
        leg on streamed rice for lunch that’s so yummy! In the evening I had a dinner with my friends at Suki Teenoi we
        were having fun together but in the middle of the meal I had a shocking news from my girlfriend that she had
        some problem with her passport and can’t go abroad anymore I tried to calm her down and finally finished my
        dinner then drove back home safely
