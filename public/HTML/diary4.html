        Today was a wonderful day! because I went out on a date with my girlfriend at café. We planned to go there at
        noon so we ordered a crispy pork and roast duck with jade noodles for breakfast it always our favorite! After
        that we just hanged out together and went to café on 2pm. It’s a huge one, we saw many people were taking a
        photo lucky for us that there’re a big parking lot too. We ordered a crème brûlée, chocolate midnight cake and
        original carbonara, both of dessert are good but not a carbonara after we finished the meal we went out and took
        a lot of photo(of my girlfriend) anyway I really happy being a photographer because she’s so cute. We came back
        home around 5pm and play with, Summer, my girlfriend’s nephew. Maybe today is the best day of the month.
