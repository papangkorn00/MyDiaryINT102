      <p>
        Today I went out with my friends to go to their house at night for about 5-6 people. He has 3 Siberian dogs
        which really big and cute, one of them blind but still playful and friendly. We sat and talked untill we were
        hungry so we prepared to order some food but there’s a friend who showered for an hour! I have no idea what’s he
        doing in there… after everyone is ready we ate together and went out to play a snooker till late after that we
        came back to eat a red pork with egg noodles around 5 pm before saying good bye to each other.
